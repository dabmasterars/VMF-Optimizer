# VMF Optimizer
Program to compress Valve Map Files (VMF) for archival purposes. Compatible with any Source Engine game.

# How it works
The program will remove parameters that have default values. When launched, Hammer will replace the missing parameters with default values; nothing changes, hence lossless optimization

# Instruction
1. Place your .vmf file in the same directory as vmfoptimizer.exe. (technical limitation for now)
2. When prompted, type the .vmf file name. Typing ".vmf" at the end of the file is not neccesary.
3. After several seconds, the optimized vmf will be ready for launch. The original file will still be available.
